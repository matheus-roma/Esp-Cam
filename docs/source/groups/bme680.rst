bme680 - Driver for BME680 digital environmental sensor
=======================================================

Functional Description of the BME680 sensor
-------------------------------------------

The BME680 sensor only support two modes, the sleep mode and the forced
mode in which measurements are done. After power-up sequence, the sensor
automatically starts in sleep mode. To start a measurement, the sensor has
to switch in the forced mode. In this mode it performs exactly one
measurement of temperature, pressure, humidity, and gas in that order,
the so-called TPHG measurement cycle. After the execution of this TPHG
measurement cycle, raw sensor data are available and the sensor returns
automatically back to sleep mode.

Using the BME680 consists of the following steps:

- Trigger the sensor to switch into forced mode to perform one THPG cycle
- Wait until the THPG cycle has been finished (measurement duration)
- Fetch raw sensor data, compensate and convert them to sensor values
